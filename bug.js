In React Native, when working with FlatList or SectionList, a common yet subtle bug arises from improper handling of the `keyExtractor` prop.  If you don't provide a unique key for each item, React Native may struggle to efficiently update the list, leading to unpredictable behavior.  This can manifest as items not rendering correctly, incorrect item positioning, or performance issues, especially with large datasets. For instance, using the index as a key (`keyExtractor={(item, index) => index}`) is a frequent mistake as it fails when items are added or removed.
